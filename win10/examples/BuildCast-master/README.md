# BuildCast Video Player UWP Sample
BuildCast is an end-to-end sample built to showcase the [Microsoft Fluent Design System](https://fluent.microsoft.com/) as well as other capabilities of the Universal Windows Platform. It permits browsing, downloading and playback of select video podcasts including a sampling of the most popular ones from Channel 9 as well as some popular Windows tech enthusiast feeds. It has other features such as ink notes, bookmarks and remote playback. This sample was initially shown and discussed at the 2017 Build conference during the [Build Amazing Apps with Fluent Design](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/B8034) talk.

# Features
At a high level this sample demonstrates usage of:
- Fluent design system (Acrylic material, Reveal highlight, Connected animations, ParallaxView, an Adobe XD UX Prototype etc)
- XAML controls and features (NavigationView, swipe commanding, context menu with icons and SVG assets, LoadedImageService, conditional XAML etc)
- Media playback including picture-in-picture and fullscreen views
- Inking and smart ink
- Project Rome and AppServices 
- Background download service, Entity Framework and SQLite
- Windows composition APIs (InteractionTracker, implicit animations, scene lighting)
- Notifications with progress bar
- Share contract 
## Run the sample

### Prepare your environment

This sample requires Visual Studio 2017 with Update 5 and the Windows 10 Software Development Kit (SDK) version 16299, Windows 10 OS - Fall Creators Update.

* [Get a copy of Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 with support for building Universal Windows apps]( https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) [includes SDK 16299]

* [Get the latest Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) [10.0.16299.0 or later]

* [Get the Windows 10 Insider SDK 16299](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) as a standalone download.

Additionally, to receive the latest updates to Windows and the development tools, and to help shape their development, join the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/ "Become a Windows Insider").
### Run
After opening the Visual Studio solution, set your startup project as **BuildCast**, the architecture to AMD64 or x86, and press F5 to run.

## Code at a glance

The table below shows the platform features used in the application and where abouts to find them in the sample. 

### Release Notes Update 1 October 2017
- Add the Adobe XD UX prototype file
- Add back Spectrum Analyzer visualization to now playing
- On startup, app will check for cached media changes at filesystem level and update database state to match this
- Improved commanding on favorites, downloads, notes
- Design tweaks 
- Known issues where there will be code changes have all been moved to issues on github
- Bug fixes

### Known Issues
- Download progress reported via toasts / action center will not update when the app quits, even though the download will proceed using background transfer service.  This is due to a known platform gap
- Deploying / running BuildCast on a XBOX will result in the app crashing due to a platform bug that is being investigated.  [More details here](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/130393/net-uwp-applications-with-a-targetplatformminversi.html).
- A number of warnings have not been addressed
- Things that didn't make it from the Build talk:
  - TreeView control: did not ship in the final Fall Creator's update
  - 360 video playback: this will come in a future update to the app
